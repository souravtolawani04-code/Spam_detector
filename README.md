# Simple Spam Checker
This is a basic Python project that checks whether a message may be spam.

The program looks for common spam words like:
"win", "free", "money", "offer", "click", "prize", "urgent", "lottery", "cash", "buy now"

If any of these words are found in the message, it marks the message as "may be spam".
Otherwise, it says the message looks safe.

## How It Works
- Takes user input
- Converts the message to lowercase
- Splits the message into words
- Checks if any spam words are present
- Prints the result

## Example
Enter a message:
You can win free money now

Output:
This message may be spam

## Technologies Used
- Python (Basic)
- String methods
- Loops
- Conditional statements
